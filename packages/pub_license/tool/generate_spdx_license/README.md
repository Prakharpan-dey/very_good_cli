# Generate SPDX License

A generator that updates the SPDX License enumerator used by the [`package:pub_license`](../../README.md).

This package should always match [PANA's](https://github.com/dart-lang/pana) license list; currently the list is deduced from the [SPDX Git Hub repository](https://github.com/dart-lang/pana/blob/master/third_party/spdx/update_licenses.dar).
