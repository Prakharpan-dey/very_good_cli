# Pub License

Developed with ðŸ’™ by [Very Good Ventures][very_good_ventures_link] ðŸ¦„

---

A Dart package which enables checking for the license of pub.dev packages.

Intented to use by Very Good CLI to extract license information. This package is likely to be ephemeral, until pub.dev exposes license information in their official API; you may track the progress [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dev/issues/4717).
